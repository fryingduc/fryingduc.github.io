## Who am I?

First of all, I'm a Viet. If you didn’t catch that when you clicked on this blog, I’m glad I get to surprise you with some (hopefully) interesting content.

My full name is **Giang Trung Minh Duc** and my friends usually call me by my last name, Duc - though some also go with Giang.

On social media platforms and programming sites, I'm much more (I hope so) recognized by my online username **fryingduc**. 

## What do I do? 

I'm attending **Hanoi - Amsterdam High School for the Gifted**, specializing in **Informatics**, class of of **2023 - 2026**.

As I mentioned earlier, I'm deeply engaged in social media platforms and programming communities, especially in the field of Competitive Programming (CP). Although I'm not extraordinarily skilled at CP, it has been a passion of mine for nearly five years (as of April 2025). Throughout this journey, CP has brought me not only joy, but also challenges, frustrations, and unforgettable memories. In case you're still curious, there is a post, both in [Vietnamese](abc), and [English](abc), about my wild-riding journey with CP for you to check it out. 

I'm also a part of the **Speedcubing** community, though I'm very active these days. I'm currently averaging sub-10 (under 10 seconds per solve) in the 3x3 category, yet I haven't gone to any official contests held by the [World Cube Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/) (how tragic, I know) so there will be no cubing content until the next cubing contest, but I can guarantee at least a post if that day would eventually come.

Overall, I'm a CP, video games and movies addict, that's it!

## What is this blog even about?

To be honest, I don't know...

There is one reason that I could make up for this blog is to say or write whatever I want and share topics I like, as everyone does that nowadays right? I'm also looking forward to posting some educational blogs, like some techniques in CP, or some contents related to cubing, etc. 

To take this in a nutshell, this blog will be a mess filled with a bunch of random sh*tposts written by me.
